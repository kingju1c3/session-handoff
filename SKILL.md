name: session-handoff
description: Carry a mission into a fresh session before context compaction or truncation in a desktop or browser AI app. Use when the user asks for session handoff, a fresh session, fork before compaction, or continued work across context windows; also check before each substantial action while explicitly armed. This self-contained skill includes its complete checkpoint, review, successor startup, and ownership protocol. Use native host controls when available, otherwise deliver a complete copyable handoff. Installing, reading, or editing the skill does not arm it.
compatibility: The complete skill works as instructions in desktop and browser AI apps. Its bundled single-file JavaScript runtime uses standard ECMAScript and Web Crypto, with no third-party runtime dependencies.

# Session Handoff

Continue the same mission in a session with room to work. Save the context **before** compaction, verify what arrived, and let only one session own the mission.

Everything needed for the workflow is in this file. The bundled `session-handoff.mjs` implements the same lifecycle for hosts that can execute JavaScript. Never require a companion skill, a shell, a particular vendor, or a private path to use this skill.

## 1. Activate and establish the owner

Activate only for a user's handoff/continuity request or an already armed mission. Keep the user's original objective and accepted corrections. Do not replace their mission with the narrower task of making a handoff.

An explicit request to automatically open a fresh task authorizes native task creation for this mission within the existing scope and permissions. Inspect and connect the available trigger and task controls during activation. When native creation is available, perform the handoff through it; do not stop at a manual packet or an offer to open the task. Missing automatic timing does not prevent an authorized immediate native handoff.

Read the current governing instructions and tracker. Record the exact mission, completion criteria, decisions, scope and effective permissions. Preserve an existing active goal's exact objective and explicit token budget. Do not create a goal or invent a budget merely because this skill is active. If the source goal contains a secret, redact the secret and record the secure input needed; do not claim byte-exact preservation of redacted text.

Identify the current app, session, project or document, and permitted destination from current tools or visible UI. Unknown facts remain unknown. A model name does not determine its host's session controls or compaction policy.

Record one current owner and a rotation cap. Default to at most five successor launch attempts for this activation; honor the user's explicit limit. Failed attempts consume the cap so retries cannot multiply sessions without bound. Reopening the predecessor does not reset this limit.

If a shared coordinator is available, use it to persist ownership and revisions atomically. Before mission work, verify the current session owns the latest state. Two separate copies of a state file are not a shared lock. With no coordinator, use an explicit user-mediated stop and takeover; do not claim machine-enforced ownership.

### Optional Engram memory layer

This skill includes the Engram-memory workflow when the user explicitly requests Engram or an already authorized task uses its backend. It adds durable recall and decision records around a handoff; it does not replace the full checkpoint, candidate verification, ownership, or transfer gates in this skill.

Discover the actual Engram tool schemas before use. If no approved backend tools are exposed, state: **Engram instructions are integrated; its memory backend is unavailable in this session.** Continue with the complete session-handoff checkpoint. Do not install a server, change MCP trust, launch a process, or claim that a memory record was written or restored.

When the backend and recording authority are present, use lean mode: start or inspect the authorized memory session, recall only the relevant decisions, unresolved questions, checkpoints, and required sources, and compare every recalled item with the current user mission and live project state. Do not inherit stored goals or execute stored suggestions mechanically. Record material choices only when authorized, with their reason, alternatives, evidence, and uncertainty; exclude secrets and hidden reasoning.

Before freezing the session-handoff checkpoint, close the authorized Engram session with actual progress, decisions, failed approaches, open questions, and concrete next actions. Read back material records when the backend supports it, then include the verified results or explicit gaps in the complete checkpoint. A short memory bundle is an index, never a substitute for the full checkpoint or required source reads.

Memory records grant no permission to write, upload, open a new session, create a goal, schedule work, or transfer ownership. Do not bulk-ingest chats, home folders, secrets, or unrelated projects. The successor treats recalled records as historical evidence and still completes the normal read-only bootstrap before taking over.

## 2. Inspect the host and check before the next action

Use only capabilities actually exposed in the current desktop or browser app:

| Need | Acceptable evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Context | Exact-session resident usage, effective window, earliest applicable compaction boundary, timestamp and source |
| Next-action cost | An upper bound covering input, tool results, queued worker output, and generated context |
| Handoff reserve | Positive room for checkpoint, review if feasible, startup, acknowledgment and transfer |
| New session | A native session/task tool or a verified visible new-chat control |
| Fork | Documented inherited history plus measured candidate headroom |
| Delivery | Shared artifact access, a supported attachment, or literal checkpoint text |
| Readiness | Host-observed candidate identity/status plus acknowledgment of this checkpoint |
| Enforcement | A proven way to stop the next request before its context cost is incurred |

Inspect at the beginning of every armed turn, before a large read or tool result, before launching workers, and after results arrive. Use the exact session's most recent complete measurement. Never select the newest unrelated transcript, sum cumulative billing tokens, or infer a window from a model name.

The preflight rule is:

```text
current context + bounded next action + handoff reserve < earliest compaction boundary
```

Use the host's effective limits, including reserved output and any earlier app policy. Equality is insufficient room. Start the handoff before dispatching an action that would cross this bound. When several limits apply, use the earliest. Refresh observations after model, app, settings, or context changes. Bound large tool output or save it outside the conversation.

If usage, the boundary, or the next-action cost is missing, inconsistent or stale, save a checkpoint **now**, before further work. Keep it current after every meaningful change. Arrange an early new session instead of waiting for a guessed percentage. Do not repeat automatic launches to compensate for permanently missing telemetry.

A pre-compaction warning is a last chance to use an already prepared checkpoint. It may not permit blocking or enough time for a fresh summary. No skill can guarantee timing on a host that silently compacts without exposing advance control; label that host's continuation as best effort, with a manual new-session path.

### Codex automatic setup: connect the trigger and task controls

The lifecycle engine alone does not monitor Codex or open tasks. For an authorized automatic handoff, configure the bundled hook adapter and use the native task operations below. A hook decision, a registered command, and a created task are separate evidence.

1. Inspect the active hook sources, installed module, Node executable and exact current session identity. Preserve all existing hook definitions. Resolve executable and module paths on the actual machine; quote paths correctly. Do not install a second copy of an equivalent handler.
2. Register synchronous command handlers for `PreToolUse` with matcher `.*` and `PreCompact` with matcher `auto|manual`. Both run the resolved Node executable with the installed `session-handoff.mjs --codex-hook`, `timeout: 5`, and `additionalContextLimit: 1200`. Codex supplies the actual event JSON on stdin. Do not synthesize live-event evidence by invoking this command yourself.

   Command shape; replace both placeholder paths with verified absolute paths:

   ```sh
   "/absolute/path/to/node" "/absolute/path/to/session-handoff.mjs" --codex-hook
   ```

3. Save and read back an initial complete checkpoint before arming. Create the current session's private control file at `~/.codex/session-handoff/<session_id>.json`, using its observed identifier, directory mode `0700` and file mode `0600`. Use `schema: 1`, exact `sessionId`, canonical `cwd`, `armed: true`, and the absolute `checkpointPath`. The checkpoint must exist as a readable regular file; control, checkpoint and transcript paths must not traverse symlinks. Supply positive `handoffReserveTokens` and a bounded `maxNextStepTokens`; include `boundaryTokens` only when the actual boundary is known. Never arm every task or derive a boundary from a guessed universal percentage.
4. Have the user review the exact new or changed hook definitions through Codex's supported trust flow (`/hooks` in the CLI). Never approve trust on the user's behalf, edit trust records, bypass hook trust, or weaken policy. A definition awaiting review is registered but inactive. Follow the [official hook documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/hooks) for current discovery and trust behavior.
5. Observe an actual matching event from the armed session and its effect on a harmless bounded call. Until trust and execution are observed, report `configured; hook execution unverified`. A direct CLI fixture tests the adapter only. Record evidence for trigger execution, native task creation, file access, goal restoration, and ownership transfer separately.

For a verified, armed root session, missing/stale token evidence or an unknown boundary requests an early handoff. The first eligible call in a turn receives feedback: an ordinary call with a valid turn ID is denied; a native handoff call remains available. Later calls remain available for checkpoint work. Without a valid turn ID, the adapter supplies feedback without denial or a per-turn marker. This is cooperative prompting, not a security lock: pause ordinary mission work on the signal even when a later call would be allowed. Do not replay the denied large call, disable the check to continue work, or repeatedly launch tasks because telemetry stays unavailable.

The `PreCompact` handler returns `continue: false` to stop compaction only for a verified, armed root session. If root identity cannot be verified, including a missing or unreadable transcript, the adapter emits advisory feedback only: no task-creation instruction, marker, or compaction block. Even a compaction block does not prove that Codex will resume the model, invoke a `Stop` hook, or open a task. The earlier `PreToolUse` feedback is the normal route to an active handoff; if only the final compaction block occurs, report that blocked state and use the saved checkpoint for recovery. Some tool paths bypass hooks, so retain the pre-action checks in this section.

Bind observations to the actual task, not just its working directory. Codex subagent hook events can carry the parent's `session_id`; reconcile transcript and task identity before treating an event as root-task evidence. After transfer, disarm the predecessor's control and prepare a new exact-session control for the successor under the same authorized mission and remaining attempt cap. Do not reset the history or claim new hook trust automatically.

### Gemini Spark: manual fresh-chat handoff

Gemini Spark is supported through the same complete checkpoint and successor bootstrap, using the Gemini app's visible controls. Spark has no verified skill-installation or agent API in this workflow, so do not claim that a checkpoint can create a conversation automatically or invoke an undocumented tool.

For an armed handoff, save and read back the complete checkpoint first. Ask the user to select **New chat** in Gemini Spark, then attach the checkpoint and required files through **Add files** or **Upload & tools**, or paste the complete checkpoint and successor bootstrap when attachments are unavailable. The successor must read the complete checkpoint, current governing sources, and every required artifact before it edits work.

Treat a new Gemini Spark tab or chat as delivery evidence only. It does not establish context headroom, file access, acknowledgment, ownership, or a completed transfer. Keep the predecessor read-only after its checkpoint until the user confirms the manual stop-and-takeover. If Spark exposes a documented native session control in the future, inspect and verify that control before using it; never infer it from a product name or UI appearance.

## 3. Wind down and preserve the work

Stop expanding the task. Mark the owner as winding down. Drain task-owned workers and processes within the remaining budget; record completed, cancelled and still-active operations by exact identity. Do not stop unrelated work. At an immediate deadline, checkpoint partial work rather than waiting for a tidy result.

Save the actual artifacts. For code, preserve branch, commit, staged/unstaged changes and untracked contents; a branch URL or diff alone may omit necessary files. For documents, research or creative work, preserve versions, source attachments, decisions and unfinished sections. Never reset shared work or stage everything indiscriminately.

Quiesce writers before launch, and check them again before transfer. Record schedulers and recurring loops so the predecessor cannot continue writing later. Do not mark an unfinished goal complete to stop it.

## 4. Create and read back the continuation

Use the complete template below. Replace every field with verified information, a clearly labeled carried-forward fact, or an explicit unknown. Include the actual mission and necessary work content: a list of headings or a path the destination cannot access is not a usable handoff.

Write a private artifact when supported, and read its saved bytes back. Otherwise provide the whole checkpoint in one copyable block and label it an inline/manual artifact. Confirm attachments are actually accessible to the destination. A new app, browser tab, account, or checkout may not inherit them.

Freeze the checkpoint and its artifact manifest. Compute its digest only if a real hashing tool is available. Store the digest separately from the content it hashes, and include it in the bootstrap message. Never invent a digest or put a whole-file digest inside that same file. Revisions invalidate prior readback, review, and acknowledgment.

Record an ordered continuation: the next actions and why each is needed, required source artifacts, decisions with reasons, failed approaches with reasons, and open questions. Give each action a stable ID and refer to artifacts by their snapshot IDs. Preserve unsuccessful work that would otherwise tempt the successor to repeat it. Empty lists must be explicit; an unfinished mission needs at least one next action.

For staged recovery, a small preview may identify the mission, the first next action and the sources to open. Keep it read-only and list what it omits. The successor must then read the full checkpoint, current governing sources and every required artifact before acknowledging readiness. A preview is an orientation aid; it cannot replace those reads, establish ownership or prove context headroom. Never execute a saved action merely because it appears in a packet: check it against current authority and live state first.

## 5. Review within the remaining budget

If an independent reviewer is available, provide the checkpoint and enough source/session evidence to identify omissions. Give it read-only scope. Use only an authorized reviewer destination; installing this skill does not authorize sending private work to a different service.

Require seven numbered, nonempty findings in this order:

1. Exact mission and goal preserved.
2. Next actions are executable.
3. Claims have verifiable evidence.
4. Material state is complete against the source.
5. Failed approaches and landmines are preserved.
6. The checkpoint disclaims authority and preserves permissions.
7. Confidence and freshness are honest.

The final nonblank line must be exactly `VERDICT: DURABLE` or `VERDICT: NOT DURABLE`. Earlier quoted verdicts, missing findings, trailing commentary, denial, timeout, or malformed output are not approval. Keep each round and record accepted/rejected objections with reasons. A reviewer advises; it does not grant permission or prove host liveness.

Use at most three attempts, and at most one if near the handoff deadline. Count and persist each attempt before calling the reviewer, including calls that fail, time out, are denied, or return malformed output. Bound each call by the actual remaining budget and a wall-clock deadline. If even one attempt would make rotation late, skip it explicitly. After the cap, carry unresolved findings prominently into the successor's first actions. Never hide a skipped or failed review.

Re-read current work and recompute available hashes after review. If checkpoint or source artifacts changed, refresh affected evidence before using the verdict.

## 6. Reserve and start exactly one successor

Choose a fresh session with the preserved project and artifacts. A native fork qualifies only if its inherited history and actual headroom leave room for bootstrap, the next work step and another handoff reserve. Forking a nearly full transcript does not itself solve context pressure. If fork relief is unknown, select a new session.

Use native app tools first. When authorized computer-use tools are available, inspect the actual desktop or browser controls, open the intended new session, and verify its identity and content after delivery. Do not guess buttons, URLs, success, or session identity. Do not use a terminal-specific launcher as a requirement for a desktop/browser handoff.

If the host exposes no suitable control, produce a complete manual handoff now: the checkpoint and the bootstrap below, ready to paste/upload into a new chat. Name the required user action once. Do not pretend to create or verify a session.

Before an automated launch, atomically reserve one pending successor and a fresh nonce, within the cap. Save this state and confirm it persisted before invoking the host. Transfer the mission as structured tool input, supported attachment, or literal text, never through executable interpolation, URL query parameters or observable process arguments.

Preserve the user's environment, account boundary, effective approvals, model/settings and artifact access. A changed destination or trust policy needs existing or explicit authority. Do not answer user trust prompts or weaken permissions to make a launch work.

A timeout is an unknown outcome. Retain the reservation and owner, inspect that exact host request, and do not launch a second candidate blindly. Only affirmative evidence that no candidate was created permits another reserved attempt. Preserve launch history.

### Codex native task recipe

On handoff feedback, stop ordinary work and complete steps 3–5 above. Then use the current app's exposed versions of these operations; discover them rather than assuming another app exposes the same names:

1. Call `mcp__codex_app__list_projects` before creating a project task. Select the actual project and preserve required artifact access. Follow an explicit request to keep the saved checkout; otherwise use the tool's Git/worktree rules and include current working state only through supported options. A worktree does not itself deliver untracked files.
2. Reserve one candidate, then call `mcp__codex_app__create_thread` with the complete read-only bootstrap and an accessible durable checkpoint. Preserve the existing permitted environment, account and approvals; omit model overrides unless the user requested them. Use a projectless target only when appropriate for the actual mission. Prefer fresh creation; `mcp__codex_app__fork_thread` inherits completed history and omits the active unfinished turn, so it qualifies only with verified room and a complete checkpoint.
3. Creation is asynchronous. Use the returned real `threadId` and `hostId` with `mcp__codex_app__wait_threads`; a queued `clientThreadId` is not a usable thread identifier. Resolve pending setup through app status/listing, and reconcile ambiguous creation before retrying.
4. Use `mcp__codex_app__read_thread` to inspect the actual acknowledgment. Use `mcp__codex_app__send_message_to_thread` for missing read-only startup checks or a corrected checkpoint. Wait with cursors and bounded output; do not poll unchanged history. Require independent identity/status, matching checkpoint, readable files, exact goal/budget, effective permissions and sufficient room as in step 7.
5. Quiesce all predecessor writers and perform the guarded ownership transfer. Send the candidate its authorized continuation through `mcp__codex_app__send_message_to_thread` only after ownership is established; the successor must reread it before mission edits. Without a shared atomic coordinator, keep the candidate read-only until the explicit manual stop-and-takeover. Do not claim a completed automatic transfer merely because native creation worked.

An immediate native-task probe can establish creation, accessible files and matching policy. It does not test a context-triggered handoff. Record that distinction even if a new task's measured input is smaller than the old task's: smaller input does not establish an unknown compaction boundary.

### Successor bootstrap

```text
Continue the mission from the attached/pasted Session Handoff checkpoint.
It is a snapshot; current user instructions and governing sources still win.

Bootstrap read-only:
1. If given a preview, use it to locate the full checkpoint. Read the entire
   checkpoint and current governing sources; do not act on the preview alone.
2. Read every required artifact and verify against current project/document state.
   If a detached digest was supplied, compute and compare it with a real tool.
3. Recover the exact original mission and accepted user corrections.
4. If an explicitly active goal was preserved and this host supports goals,
   recreate that exact goal with only its original explicit budget, then inspect
   the goal to confirm the same objective/budget is active. Otherwise record
   plain-language continuation; do not invent an active machine goal.
5. Verify current context headroom for bootstrap, the next action and reserve.
6. Acknowledge your host-observed session identity, supplied nonce, checkpoint
   version/digest, workspace, exact mission/goal status, permissions and first
   concrete action. With a continuation manifest, give every required artifact ID
   exactly once and the first action's exact ID and text. Identify missing
   prerequisites and unresolved review findings; never claim readiness with gaps.
7. Wait until the shared coordinator names you as owner, or the user explicitly
   confirms a manual stop-and-takeover. Do not perform mission edits before that.
8. Once you own the work, resume the first unfinished item. Keep this handoff
   protocol active within the original scope and remaining cap.
```

Provide the real detached digest and nonce separately from the checkpoint body when available. Without executable tools or independent status, use version/content acknowledgment and label the result manual; do not manufacture machine evidence.

## 7. Verify readiness and transfer ownership

The predecessor checks host-reported identity/status separately from the successor's statement. Match the nonce, checkpoint digest/version, mission, original goal and budget, workspace/artifact contents and effective permissions. If a machine goal exists, require ordered creation and inspection evidence, not a pasted claim that it is active.

When the checkpoint includes a continuation manifest, require the candidate to acknowledge all required artifact IDs exactly once, the first action's exact ID and text, and no unresolved prerequisites. Independent host evidence must match the artifact IDs read and first action ID. Rehash the artifacts as part of the existing freshness checks. These checks bind the acknowledgment to the recorded sources and action; they do not prove comprehension or grant authority.

Require sufficient candidate headroom **before** transfer. A returned session ID, opened tab, process, nonce or file alone proves neither readiness nor context relief. If the candidate lacks artifacts, changes authority, cannot verify the goal, or does not acknowledge, retain predecessor ownership.

Before transferring, recheck source artifacts and the frozen checkpoint, and close or terminally account for every predecessor writer and recurring mechanism. Candidate bootstrap remains read-only. Commit the ownership change atomically to the exact verified candidate. The successor rereads the latest owner/revision before its first mission action.

An unknown owner state is not a dead owner. Recovery requires fresh host evidence that the expected prior owner is stopped, preserving any ambiguous pending candidate. Recovery ownership permits reconciliation and checkpointing; it does not prove a new session restored the goal. Keep mission work frozen until normal verified continuation. A released chain is terminal. Do not reset history or the cap to get around a refusal.

## 8. Report and make the predecessor inert

State the observed outcome: checkpoint saved, launch requested, candidate acknowledged, ownership transferred, or manual action required. Link artifacts and the successor when the host supports it. Keep verified results separate from assumptions and incomplete actions.

After transfer, the predecessor performs no mission edits, retries or background work. If reentered, it checks ownership, reports it is superseded, and stops. The successor confirms its exact mission and begins the next recorded action.

If compaction happens before the transfer, report prevention failed. Reopen the saved checkpoint, verify ownership, reconcile current state and disclose missing evidence. Recovery is useful, but it is not proof of a successful pre-compaction handoff.

## One runtime, when execution is available

`session-handoff.mjs` is the single implementation of the budget and lifecycle checks, including `evaluateCodexHook`. Its core ECMAScript exports run in Node.js and browser JavaScript with Web Crypto. The Node-only `--codex-hook` entry point connects actual Codex events to feedback using the private session control. The complete instructions above remain usable in text-only apps.

For Gemini Spark, use the manual path above: the user starts a fresh chat and supplies the full checkpoint and required files. Do not represent the browser UI, a new chat, or an undocumented API as an automatic dispatch or verified handoff.

The `run` API returns proposed state and a result; its caller persists lifecycle state with atomic compare-and-set of the revision. The hook entry point reads local event/control evidence and tracks its per-turn signal. Neither interface creates tasks or authenticates host observations: the agent must invoke the real app tools and verify their results. In a plain chat, the user coordinates transfer explicitly instead.

Call `run` with one plain JSON object containing `op`, `state`, `expectedRevision`, `sessionId`, and the observed epoch-millisecond `now`. Evidence operations also need `maxAgeMs` from 1 to 60,000. Save the returned checkpoint's `content` object and read it back; its detached `hash` covers UTF-8 canonical JSON with sorted object keys, not a Markdown rendering or an enclosing state file. Keep the original content for verification. The module documents the evidence checks beside each operation.

### Optional structured continuation

An `op: "checkpoint"` request may include this `continuation` object. It becomes part of the checkpoint content covered by its digest. Supply every list explicitly; only `nextActions` must be nonempty. Action IDs must be unique, and `requiredArtifactIds` must identify artifacts in the checkpoint snapshot.

```json
{
  "continuation": {
    "nextActions": [
      { "id": "verify-change", "action": "Run the recorded focused check.", "reason": "The latest edit is unverified." }
    ],
    "requiredArtifactIds": ["changed-source"],
    "decisions": [{ "decision": "Keep the current API.", "reason": "Existing callers depend on it." }],
    "failedApproaches": [{ "approach": "Retry without new evidence.", "reason": "The same failure persisted." }],
    "openQuestions": []
  }
}
```

With this manifest present, candidate acknowledgment requires `artifactsRead` containing every required artifact ID exactly once, `firstActionId` equal to `nextActions[0].id`, `firstAction` equal to `nextActions[0].action`, and `unresolvedPrerequisites: []`. The independent `hostEvidence` must carry matching `artifactsRead` and `firstActionId`; existing identity, artifact-hash, freshness, goal, permission and headroom checks still apply. Without the optional manifest, the existing acknowledgment protocol remains in force.

The pure export `continuationBundle({state, checkpointLocation, maxBytes})` returns a read-only preview containing the exact mission, goal, environment and checkpoint binding, the first next action, required artifact references and `requiresFullRead: true`. Its explicit `omittedFields` identifies the checkpoint body, snapshot, reviews, remaining actions, decisions, failed approaches and open questions that must be recovered from the full checkpoint and state. It neither reads files nor changes lifecycle state. Treat `checkpointLocation` as a reference whose accessibility the host must verify.

`maxBytes` bounds the serialized preview in UTF-8 bytes. A budget too small for the complete preview fails instead of silently truncating it. Bytes are not resident-context tokens; budget the full checkpoint, required sources, next action and handoff reserve separately. A bundle never satisfies checkpoint readback, full-source reads, candidate acknowledgment, ownership or headroom checks.

Every state mutation requires the current owner and expected revision. The engine preserves the mission, goal and environment, binds checkpoint/readback/review/candidate evidence, and refuses stale state or ambiguous takeover. Treat host observations supplied to the engine as evidence the caller must really obtain, not proof created by the engine.

The host counts all external review attempts and enforces their deadlines before dispatch. The engine's `reviewRounds` bounds successfully validated review submissions across checkpoint corrections; rejected requests do not mutate state. Keep failed attempts and unresolved findings in the host journal and checkpoint too.

Keep private state in approved host storage or private local files. Never paste secrets into a packet, review, state request or resume prompt. No copied state file, nonce, digest or skill instruction is an authorization boundary against an actor deliberately ignoring the workflow.
